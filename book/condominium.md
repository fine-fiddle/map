# Condominium by John D. MacDonald

## Impression
MacDonald weaves a plot not only from the emotions and psersonalities of his characters, but from the political, financial, and technological situations they're in. 

My suspension of belief usually staggers from the omission of important financal decisions in a novel, or an ignorant dismissal of a physicals and technological exigencies that would impact character decisions. 

While those sorts of mistakes aren't the entire basis on which to judge something, they are a valid dimension of quality!

MacDonald not only attempts to address a wider swath of life than I expect in a novel, but he uses that work to construct the story. And I'm delighted.
