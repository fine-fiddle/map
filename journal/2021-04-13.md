Cynthia made herself angry trying to do virtual environments for her new job take home assignment. 

Evening Dog Walk:
- Thinking about how to diagram the city trash issues. 
- thinking about how to diagram rat system
- Thinking about how rat system would make a game.

Nighttime:
- I put swivel mounts on dad's 10/22 for sling. Took like 2 hours. Didn't help that I ate enough gummies to be high. 
- I installed a power outlet in lighting branch in basement. Found that the switched branch needed two separate breakers thrown to power down. Tempted to take many shortcuts, which in retrospect, may have killed me.
