Went to Appleseed shoot with Omar.

Didn't do too bad with some groups, but i need a lot of practice with sight placement.

sighted in my leliya at the end, seems very accurate.

Saw parents on my way home. Slightly sunburned.

Omar didn't bring a lunch so i made him a sandwich.. corned beef, mustard, jalapeno cheese, mayo, tomato- on Turano bread.
