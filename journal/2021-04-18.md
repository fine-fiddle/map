I made three batches of gummies, mystery flavors, but all sour. Sour coconut was the only one we could verify.

Cynthia wanted to watch TV all night, i started with "Persona" a HBO shit-documentary about how personality tests are used by companies to pre-judge applicants.

She watchd the space soap opera for the rest of the night, no headphones, while im trying to write this journal and plan the week.
