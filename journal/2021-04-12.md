- Household
  - Planted grass seed during lunch, and scattered the remains of my hay over it. 

Cynthia picked up Karina from O'Hare while i some hamburger and noodles, bought groceries, and watched an episode of south park. 

Not sure if I feel like i did enough for the day. Feeling a bit depressed and discouraged, in general. Like will i ever communicate with Cynthia. I felt irritated by her 'work voice' as i listened to her yelling into her video calls today.
