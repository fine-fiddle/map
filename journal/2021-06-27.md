Spoke to dad today and he might be dyin.
The doctor wanted to jump right back in and cut him open again after his original bladder surgery.

Im sad i didn't get to know dad better, and that i had a kid so late he won't get to grow up with grandpa.

I'm also sad that he talks through a script so much, through some dumb ass self help books and positivity, rather than through what he has to say himself, and his own thoughts.
