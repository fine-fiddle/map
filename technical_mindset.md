# Technical Mindset

Technical vs non-technical mindset. 

Today Cynthia became frustrated and ranted about how someone changed data to be case sensitive and it broke Looker. When she went to fix it, she was using the wrong data source so it still didn't seem fixed! Her frustrated emotions animated her.

This is an example of the non-techincal mindset. It rests on mistaken apprehsension of components: Certainty, Respect, Curiosity, Control.

All these concepts have multiple definitions, and I'll describe what I'm talking about so we can get on the same page.

## Respect

'Respect' here refers to how one relates to something.

Examples: 
- how does a friend respect a friend? 

- How does a child _respect_ a parent?
  - What ability does a child have to appeal (influence) a decision by their parent?
    - emotional manipulation, if a child is sad, their parent may feel pity and break their rules
  - What role do the child's emotions play?
  - What expectations can a child have about the parent's decision making process? 
    - fairness
    - consultation
  - How does a parent feel when a child violates a parent's request?
  - How does a child feel when a parent doesn't fulfil the child's request?
  - What is a rational way for a child to feel when the parent doesn't heed the kid's request.

- How does an employee _respect_ their boss?

- How does one _respect_ uneven stairs? Or Hail? or cold. Hammer?
  - what is a logical way to feel towards the uneven stair? 

## Certainty
- How do you know what level of respect to pay to things? 
- Where do your expectations of something's behavior come from? 
- Is certainty a binary idea, or a probabilistic idea?

If something seems to do what you want, can you be certain it did what you want? 

## Curiosity
  - When confronted with something to which you have no appeal, and do not understand, what emotional reaction is most likely allow you to get your way?


## Control ? 

The non-techincal mindset is characterized by the expectation that things are your subjects.
Anger or frustration is an appropriate reaction when your subject violates your dictates. 

The technical mindset does not have a strong expectation about the behavior of things. The thing may or may not behave as you desire. They may mor may not behave as you expect. When one observes the thing behaving in a certain way, one is not certain one understands the full behavior, and thinks of certainty in terms of percent. One must be curious about the decision making process, and how it works.
