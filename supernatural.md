# Aliens Angels and Demons

## Introduction.
Life is an unusual situation. Outrageously complex, impossibly simple. Beyond value, and without worth. And as many people as say the word, none of them mean the same thing by it. 

This tale concerns two of the more common definitions, and the curious way they intersect. Let's talk about Life, the way men interact and the fortunes they experience on their way from birth to the grave. And let's talk about Life, the biochemical process that attempts to reproduce itself within the environment.

## Background
### The Soul
Here's an area that is both complex and simple. Did you know that the ancients meant something specific when they started using the word soul? They meant _The part of a person that Thinks_. Today, we might call it 'consciousness'. Thats a simple enough idea, and even thousands of years later it continues to make sense in many of the nonsensical contexts where 'soul' is used.
In the first sense of Life, understanding the soul only became complex when, in their social relations, men have tried to trick and control each other.  
In the second sense of Life, the soul has always been an outrageous complexity.

### Flatland
In general, the soul of a man concerns itself with the movement of mass and energy in three dimensions. We evolved from animals that oozed and swam in three dimensions while following patterns that caused them to grow and multiply.
But the general case is not complete, and the souls of some men poke outside of the length, width and depth of things. Most often, these journeys out of space time are considered an annoyance and we only undergo them to aid us in some work on the mass and energy that our lives are really concerned with. Take math, for example. We might use math to plan how to build a shelter, or judge the value of a deal. But math, with its origins in the imagination, doesn't stop at the stock market or a spaceship. The rules inherent to itself lead men beyond any application we know in the world, into what so far appear to be unusual structures with no correspondance in our world.

### 
The world of ideas and natural order, where Math seems to rule, is not the only extra-dimensional existence that intersects with the world of man.

Let's go back to the Soul, a simple idea buried under the complexity of the competition between forces of men. An idea that everyone would agree they know what is meant, but few would attempt to explain te complexity of how it works.
