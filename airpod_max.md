# airpod max problems
- H0YDL1H701TV model A2096 version 3C39

## 2021-03-17 glitch and disconnect
- Started breaking up when listening to apple music from my work MBP
- pause and start on computer worked once, the next time it appeared to play, but no sound from Maxes
- The ANC button and the volume button didn't do anything.
- showed 90% battery through bluetooth on computer
- Looked to see where they were connected, showed up in both the bluetooth on my phone and my computer. Disconnect both through bluetooth.

- ANC or Crown still don't work.
- Try to hold the buttons together to do the reboot. Nothing happens.
- Plug in to power, and i was able to do the 'hold till orange amber light flashes" reset
- Able to connect via bluetooth, still don't hear anything on Iphone XS or MacBook Pro 16" 2019
- ANC button and Crown still don't work
- Plugged into power again, without pushing buttons LED pulses white for a while, nothing changes. Doesn't show up as new device on phone or anything.

- Avisor says to factory defaults Earpods Max: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211904
  - It won't flash white, only amber
- Asks to do it again
  - orange flash at like 12s, turned green at 43s solid green at 90s or so, black at 120. green again at 2:15
- asks to connect to phone
  - I connect to original name in phone, through audio output selector. (no factory reset.) Flashes for a second, then disappears from audio device list, then reappears, not connected
  - tapped them as bluetooth device only, that says connected.
  - Then tried to tap in Audio Device list
  - spins, connected, allows me to play. No audio. Crown and ANC button unresponsive.
- Asks me to mail in headset.

## 2021-04-02 Store visit for 03-17 issue
- I came in with my screenshot of the original chat session, plus my picture of the instructions that came with the packing material for sending in the headphones- neither of which mentioned removing the ear cups
- She said, and wrote in the ticket notes that i had to sign “customer claims he was not told to remove ear cups”
- and “as a courtesy, we’ll replace them this time. I believe your story” like she was doing me a favor
- I asked her to record the fact that i had a photo showing the instructions, and it wasn’t a wild claim that she was choosing to believe, but several pieces of evidence, she didn’t want to put that in the note
- also they can only ship to the store, so i have to figure out how to get back to Michigan Ave apple store again.
