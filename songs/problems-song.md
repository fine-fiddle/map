# problems song

There aint no problems
Not a worry on my mind. (etc. braggadocio)

(under my breath)
just babies i got to make
online polluting my kids mind
work to put food on the plate
rent the landlord is trying to take
half my friends is fake
bills to pay/payments
revenege i gotta take
some people i must kill

but the idea is that these aren't problems, just
