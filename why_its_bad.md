# Why the USA sucks

For context, consider Taibbi's "[The American Media is Destroying Itself](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-news-media-is-destroying-itself)"

The media in the last four years has devolved into a succession of moral manias. We are told the Most Important Thing Ever is happening for days or weeks at a time, until subjects are abruptly dropped and forgotten, but the tone of warlike emergency remains

I think that the competition for monety that adtech forces on media drives them to make the news a superstimulus so they win the viewers. 
superstimulus food uses the max fat, sugar, and salt possible before disgusting the palate
superstimulus news uses the max danger, group dynamics and ? (sex?) possible before disgusting the reader.

Facebook or google are largely responsible for making the media so much more competitive. 

but an underlying problem is the fact that the country is ready to eat you alive without a lot of money, take your housing, take your ability to feed yourself or support your kids.
