### Black Beans By Pint, test 1
- The original goal was to try black beans by themselves and see how many fit in the jar.
- I abandoned the goal and tried the whole recipe.

#### Weights and Measures
- Pint Jar itself weighs 266g
- Black Bean Measures
  - 1/2c black beans
    - 105g
  - 1/3c
    - 75g
- 2/3c
  - 136g ??? - why is this not double 1/3?
    - inaccurate measuring cups?
- 1c  = 210g

- +~ 37g onion + ~ 25 g red pep + ~2 slices jalapeno
- +11g jalapeno
- +1/4 tsp table salt
- +1/2 tsp oregano
- +1/8 (scant) cumin
- +1/2 tsp ancho
- +6g garlic
- water to max line.

Tightened tattler with three fingers on the jar, left hand, and three fingers on the band, right hand. Used as much strength as i was comfortable with, firm but not straining
Test in duromatic. Fill with warm water to about water level in pints

### Soaking Experiment - Black Beans
- Dry Measures. Want to understand volume and weight of soaked beans for easier canning process.
  - 200g black beans soaking at 11:30am
  - 200g was two half cups
    - actually 210g for a true 2x 1/2 cup load. so im testing a scant cup.
  - 381g after soaking till 20:30
- 200g dry (381 wet) was too much in quart jar. I had also put in a bunch of onions and peppers etc.
  - Also jar was filled with liquid to just below the mark.

### Soaking Quart Experiment 2
- gonna try 175g dry beans per jar
  - Also, stay half an inch below the line.
\frac{200}{381} = \frac{175}{x} = 331g for my new storage size. Actually ended up being like 320.
