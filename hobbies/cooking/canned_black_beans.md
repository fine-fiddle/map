## Original Recipe

### Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tbsp oil of olives
- [ ] 1 cup chopped onion
- [ ] 1tbsp Chile pow
- [ ] 1.5 tsp cumin seed
- [ ] 1.5 teasp oregano
- [ ] 7 c water
- [ ] 1lb (2.5 c) black bean
- [ ] 4oz chorizo
- [ ] 4-6clob minced garlic
- [ ] 2 bay
- [ ] Salt to taste

### NYT Process
1. In a 6-quart or larger stovetop pressure cooker or an electric pressure cooker, heat the oil over medium-high heat or using the saut√© function. Stir in the onions, chile powder, cumin and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to soften, about 1 minute.
2. Add the water, beans, chorizo, garlic and bay leaves.
3. Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 30 minutes. If using an electric pressure cooker, cook on high pressure for 30 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat if using a stovetop cooker, and allow the pressure to come down naturally, about 15 minutes. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow the steam to escape.
5. Stir well. Discard the bay leaves and add salt to taste. The soup will thicken on standing.
6. Just before serving, prepare the avocado salsa by tossing the ingredients together in a bowl. Ladle the soup into bowls and top each portion with a large dollop of salsa.

## Notes from Borrachos
- 3/4 full for pints. 1.5" below max (by that do i mean below the max line or the lid?)
- less than 1/4 c beans (when adding 3/4 tsp barley, 1 tsp wild rice)
  - beans are said to triple in size when cooked
  - 1/4c kidney is 50g
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 50g or less meat chunk
- 4-5 huge masa corn kernels
- 2 dried mushrooms
- grain on top of vegetables, prevent glue bottom when grain expands beneath everything.
