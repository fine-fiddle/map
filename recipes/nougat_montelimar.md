   2. When honey hits 108°C/226°F, begin to whip the whites at high speed.
   3. When honey hits 120°C/248°F, exchange for glucose mixture

4. Pour the hot honey into the whipping whites, continue whipping on high speed as the sugars cook.
5. When sugars reach 115°C/311°F remove vanilla pod, pour into whites as quickly as they will accept it without collapsing. continue whipping on high for 3 minutes.
6. Add melted cocoa butter. This will separate the nougat, but it'll become smooth again in around 30 seconds.
7. Remove bowl of inclusions from warm oven and scrape in hot nougat, mix with wooden spoon or gloved hand.
8. Place the nougat onto 8.5x11" rice paper and spread it uniform.
9. place a second paper on top and use clean rolling pin to flatten.
10. Cool it completely, or store overnight.
11. Square the edges of nougat, cut the rectangle in half lengthwise.
12. Using serrated or chef's knife, cut each half into 1" strips to make 4" x 1" bars.

Note: if the nougat does not become smooth again after the cofcoa butter is added, warm it with a torch or heat gun while it is whipping, until it becoms smooth.
