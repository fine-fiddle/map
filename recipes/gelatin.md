  - [x] [Pipettes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N65NXHA)
- [x] Molds. Would be clutch to have 3d molds
  - [x] [Multi ML](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0832GFTXX)
  - [x] [Single ML](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QZ34SMV)
- [ ] Last: Figure out volume adjustment for gelatin plus H20
- [ ] Determine if Jello® works for gummies
- [ ] Figure out raw gelatin process
- [ ] Hotplate based mixing? Flask?
- [ ] Figure out size per gummy.

## 2nd Experiment 2021-03-15
Small Jello® in bowl- 3oz in .25c H20
- Difficult to dissolve.
  - Preheated bowl and measuring cup.
  - Stirred in bain marie.
  - Stirred continuously till it began to thicken.
  - Could see chunks inside the whole time.
- Poured into v. lightly greased bowl for cooling.

## First Experiment 2021-03-14
Large Jello® Packet (6oz) in .75c H20 @ 200°F
- Easy to Dissolve
- Settled into 2 layers
  - Top Layer felt like jello, but very firm and cohesive
  - Bottom layer felt like plastic or something, more like what I'd want.
  - Neither layer really seemed like it'd be safe in your pocket.
- Was able to release from cup, as thick cube thing. Not easy though.
  - Next time need a technique- put cup in boiling water to heat outer layer?
  - blow air underneath it with compressor?

## Process
- [ ] Filter magnesium stearate
