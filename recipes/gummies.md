### Prep
 1. Make starch molds
 2. Put funnel in the oven to heat.
 3. start water bath (for gelatin melt)
 4. Start water bath (for funnel reheater- maybe can do both somehow?)
 5. Hydrate Gelatin, stirring it into cold water.
 6. Combine sugars
    1. Sugar Water Glucose. I used light corn syrup.
    2. Note: you're supposed to add glucose syrup after the sucrose and water is boiling and dissolved- easier to dissolve sucrose without the presence of glucose syrup.
    3. Note: Lower DE syrups contribute to a chewy texture, higher DE syrups resuot in a shorter texture & more sweetness.

### Cooking
1. Cook sugar mix to 275°F (125°C)
2. Cool sugar mix to 242°F (120°C)
3. Melt Gelatin over a water bath then add to 242°F syrup.
   1. This will take a little longer than the cooling process.
   2. Mix flavor, acid(?) and color into gelatin before adding to sugar
4. Using preheated funnel, deposit into starch molds. Starch Mold Technique on p74

## 7th 2021-05-25 half recipe, medicated
35 vyvanses, attempt to remove lubricant
2.7ml teal cube, 1/4 batch = ~200ml, 74 gummies... est.
need 70 with 35 vyvanses.

225g bowl for water additions
target = 355g
1 wash - 266g

came out to 183 gummies. Not tooo much waste, and turned much of the waste into balls that i weighed to match the size of a cube
each gummy is about 1/5th a 70mg pill aka 14mg

- gummy sticks to stainless better than silicone or wood, so get waste on silicone or wood and then wrap it on a butter knife
- Make the gummy tougher by putting a larger batch of gelatin into the syrup!
- lightly coating them with oil makes them easy to handle, and it's easy to do. I rubbed it on with gloved hands.

- was very difficult to mix, and some hard candy had formed.
- beautiful color (yellow)
- flavor a bit gross (orange cream)

- cooked to 180F. sprinkled a little extra gelatin on the top
- this filled maybe 2x 126 cube trays. (was very sloppy)
- turned off heat completely when it hit 240.
- Tried to mix dilligently, and there were some lumps left. maybe could have fixed it by removing the thermometer and scraping the whole bottom
- It was colder than usual, but that didn't hurt things too much.

- melted gelatin too early becasue i was looking at pan-bottom sensor rather than syrup temperature
- gelatin wasn't well mixed with the syrup, saw stripes when I was depositing.
- some of the syrup had congealed to the bottom of the pan
- syrup seemed more likely to spatter, makes me wonder what pure syrup would have been like.
  - Definitely needed eye protection, and leather gloves wouldn't have been a bad idea.
  - in early cooking it seemed like only the bottom was at boiling temperature.

## 2nd Attempt 2021-04-18 Half Batch, Full Sucrose
### Results
- did crystalize when cooling
- tender sticky gummies
- gummies dried with crystalized outsides
- 
### Hypothesis
- Full Sucrose should make long bite.
- Half Batch shouldn't affect.
- est glucose syrup is 70% solids

### Attempt
12 drops violet
4-5 drops watermelon. need a pipette next time.
2 tsp citric in the gelatin before mixing with sugar.
Sugar crystalized while cooling down to 245. Remelted with boiling when adding gelatin.

## First Attempt 2021-04-11
- Light Corn Syrup instead of Glucose Syrup
- put splash of tropical fruit punch flavor in melted gelatin
- used sunset yellow food color, but how many drops? 6? 12?
- put food color in gelatin
- put 2 tsp of citric acid in sugar
- accidentally turned sugar down to 100F and then back up to 240F
- Used '40 cavity' 8x5 (cavity) molds 1.2"x1.2" .40z (3cm sq x 1.5cm deep).
- produced 63 gummies, and a considerable amount of waste. I'd estimate 2.5 wasted.

### Questions to Take Away
- [Glucose Syrup from Powder](https://blog.modernistpantry.com/advice/glucose-powder-but-i-need-syrup/)
- Can you add acid to gelatin. Can you add flavor and color to gelatin?
- Should it foam up when you add the gelatin to the sugar?

1. Make starch molds
2. Hydrate Gelatin, stirring it into cold water.
3. Combine sugar, water, glucose in saucepan.
   1. Cook to 275°F (125°C)
   2. Remove from heat, cool to 242°F (120°C)
4. Melt Gelatin over a water bath then add to syrup. Add the flavoring, acid, and coloring.
5. Using preheated funnel, deposit into starch molds. Starch Mold Technique on p74
6. Dust starch on top and store in molds at room temp overnight
7. Remove gummies from molds. Brush off starch. Toss with vegetable oil to seal & add shine.

Notes: Vital to keep batch hot whle depositing. Keep a pot of boiling water at the ready, immerse funnel in water to reheat as depositing slows.
