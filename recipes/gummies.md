### Prep
 1. Make starch molds
 2. Put funnel in the oven to heat.
 3. start water bath (for gelatin melt)
 4. Start water bath (for funnel reheater- maybe can do both somehow?)
 5. Hydrate Gelatin, stirring it into cold water.
 6. Combine sugars
    1. Sugar Water Glucose. I used light corn syrup.
    2. Note: you're supposed to add glucose syrup after the sucrose and water is boiling and dissolved- easier to dissolve sucrose without the presence of glucose syrup.
    3. Note: Lower DE syrups contribute to a chewy texture, higher DE syrups resuot in a shorter texture & more sweetness.

### Cooking
1. Cook sugar mix to 275°F (125°C)
2. Cool sugar mix to 242°F (120°C)
3. Melt Gelatin over a water bath then add to 242°F syrup.
   1. This will take a little longer than the cooling process.
   2. Mix flavor, acid(?) and color into gelatin before adding to sugar
4. Using preheated funnel, deposit into starch molds. Starch Mold Technique on p74

## First Attempt 2021-04-11
- Light Corn Syrup instead of Glucose Syrup
- put splash of tropical fruit punch flavor in melted gelatin
- put food color in gelatin
- put 2 tsp of citric acid in sugar
- accidentally turned sugar down to 100F and then back up to 240F
- Used '40 cavity' 8x5 (cavity) molds 1.2"x1.2" .40z (3cm sq x 1.5cm deep).
- produced 63 gummies, and a considerable amount of waste. I'd estimate 2.5 wasted.

### Questions to Take Away
- [Glucose Syrup from Powder](https://blog.modernistpantry.com/advice/glucose-powder-but-i-need-syrup/)
- Can you add acid to gelatin. Can you add flavor and color to gelatin?
- Should it foam up when you add the gelatin to the sugar?

1. Make starch molds
2. Hydrate Gelatin, stirring it into cold water.
3. Combine sugar, water, glucose in saucepan.
   1. Cook to 275°F (125°C)
   2. Remove from heat, cool to 242°F (120°C)
4. Melt Gelatin over a water bath then add to syrup. Add the flavoring, acid, and coloring.
5. Using preheated funnel, deposit into starch molds. Starch Mold Technique on p74
6. Dust starch on top and store in molds at room temp overnight
7. Remove gummies from molds. Brush off starch. Toss with vegetable oil to seal & add shine.

Notes: Vital to keep batch hot whle depositing. Keep a pot of boiling water at the ready, immerse funnel in water to reheat as depositing slows.
