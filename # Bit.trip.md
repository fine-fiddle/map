1. When things go well, I have a tendency to think "I am doing well", and stumble. Feels like what people mean by egoism. Then when I'm stumbling, I tend to think "I am doing poorly." Instead, what if things going well is the univers in accord with itself? And things going poorly is... (haven't thought this through) a lack of synchronization?
2. When things are getting intense, I tense up, and strain my muscles, and feel a weight of importance. Similar to putting on a scowl to show concentration or hard work. Scowling isn't related to hard work. The weighty tension i enact isn't related to success. Nerves? I give myself nerves? Why?
3. Remember the dog training scenario, where the dog beats itself up and becomes discouraged, or becomes overly cocky and messes up. Maintaining the balance, the state of receiptve focus.
4. After a mistake, I have a tendency to pause, maybe not to beat myself up, but to dwell on it, under the guise of analyzing what happened? This is a break from the focus attentive state that corresponds to being in accord with what is happening.
